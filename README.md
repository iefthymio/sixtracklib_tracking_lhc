# Tracking LHC with sixtracklib

First prepare the line by running scripts get_beambeam_macros.sh,000,001,003a  
Then copy the line and the closed orbit pickle files in the folder you want to use them in (e.g. Footprint, DynamicAperture, etc.)

You need sixtrack compiled to run the other scripts of PrepareLine
